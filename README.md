# FED 27 - Course 4

This is the repo where I'll try to store the code that we write/talk about during classes.

## The setup

I'm trying to create folders for the different weeks and session. There might not be a file for each session, if we didn't write any code during that session for example.

Each folder is supposed to be used with node and there will most probably exist a `package.json` file. That means that when you want to run the code, you might first need to run: `npm i` (short for `npm install`) inside the folder.

For example, if I want to run `simple-api.js` in the first session I would:

1. Navigate to the correct folder: `cd week1/session1-api`
1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
1. Run the code `node simple-api.js` (or `node --watch simple-api.js` if I want changes to be automatically reloaded)
