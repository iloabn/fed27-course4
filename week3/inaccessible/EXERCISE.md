# A11y and SEO exercise

Greetings!
I have together with a statistical generator (LLM) created a really inaccessible website! It's about my favorite animal, the _Flarmlurv_.
However... I have forgotten a lot about how to make accessible stuff 😱

**Please help 🥺**

## Context

There are 4 pages.

- `facts.html`
- `gallery.html`
- `index.html`
- `sightings.html`

Each of those focus on different issues, but they also share a lot of issues.

## Your mission

As a way to practice making accessible things your mission is going to be to do a couple of things:

1. Go through the different pages and note down things you notice that aren't accessible, just by looking at the pages in a browser
1. Open up the code and go through the pages, note down things that you think should change
1. Start changing the website (both `style.css` and the different `.html`-files) to make it more accessible

## How do I know if I did good?

To test how accessible a website is, the best thing is always to let real people test the website and tell you. Unfortunately we don't have access to people that are experienced in testing right now. But we can use browser extensions that are able to catch some issues for us.

I recommend installing either [WAVE](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) or [axe Dev Tools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd) and then running them on the page _after_ you have fixed the page to see what things those tools are noticing and commenting about.
